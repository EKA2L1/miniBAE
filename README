<p>The platform-neutral
 Beatnik Audio Engine, Mini Edition (miniBAE) is an exceptionally
 mature, well-rounded, and reliable computer music and sound system
 specially customized for small-footprint and embedded applications.
 </p> 

<p>miniBAE is... </p> 

<p><strong>Flexible</strong> </p> 

<p>It can
 play several leading industry-standard music and audio file formats
 from disk or from memory. </p>
 

<p><strong>Interactivity-oriented</strong> </p> 

<p>You can pause and
 resume any media playback at will, change pitch while a sound is
 playing, etc.The feature-rich miniBAE API is full of opportunities for
 innovative integration of sound design into interactive virtual worlds–
 for example, miniBAE includes a MIDI synthesizer that your application
 – or user – can play in real-time. </p>
 

<p><strong>Great-Sounding</strong> </p> 

<p>The audio engine DSP quality
 is very good, comparable to high-end PC wavetable sound cards even
 though the processing is entirely software-based, and audio quality is
 selectable all the way from 8-bit 8 kHz up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz. </p>
 

<p><strong>Powerful and Extensible</strong> </p> 

<p>The miniBAE music
 synthesizer is a high-quality wavetable instrument with LFOs, ADSRs,
 and filters. It can be delivered with a complete General MIDI patch
 bank, or for small footprints a ‘light’ General MIDI approximation can
 be used. Custom instrument banks can be built with the Beatnik Editor
 application. </p> 

<p><strong>Efficient</strong> </p> 

<p>Despite
 miniBAE’s power, the per-voice processor load is impressively low. </p>
 

<p><strong>Hardware Independent – Sound Card-Agnostic</strong> </p>
 

<p>Some other sound systems require consumers to buy expensive (and
 quickly out- dated) hardware sound cards – but miniBAE avoids nearly
 all sound card support issues because it’s 100% software. miniBAE
 requires no particular sound hardware in the host system, only an audio
 output. </p> 

<p><strong>Consistent Across Platforms</strong> </p>
 

<p>Because it’s a software-only solution, consistently great-sounding
 music is much easier to achieve with miniBAE than with many other
 computer music systems. </p> 

<p><strong>An Inexpensive Cross-Platform
 Audio Solution</strong> </p> 

<p>miniBAE provides the same music and
 sound capabilities on every supported plat- form, so porting music and
 sound content is a no-brainer, requiring literally no additional sound
 artist work – simply re-use the files. </p>

 a contribution in some important way. Its amazing to me that two
 scruffy guys working in our house created something that went around
 the world and in lots of peoples pockets. </p> 

<p>Thank you all. </p>
