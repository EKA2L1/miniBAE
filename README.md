# What is miniBAE?

 The platform-neutral
 Beatnik Audio Engine, Mini Edition (miniBAE) is an exceptionally
 mature, well-rounded, and reliable computer music and sound system
 specially customized for small-footprint and embedded applications.

 miniBAE is...

## Flexible

 It can play several leading industry-standard music and audio file
 formats from disk or from memory. 

## Interactivity-oriented

 You can pause and resume any media playback at will, change pitch while
 a sound is playing, etc.The feature-rich miniBAE API is full of
 opportunities for innovative integration of sound design into
 interactive virtual worlds– for example, miniBAE includes a MIDI
 synthesizer that your application – or user – can play in real-time.
 
## Great-Sounding

 The audio engine DSP quality is very good, comparable to high-end PC
 wavetable sound cards even though the processing is entirely
 software-based, and audio quality is selectable all the way from 8-bit
 8 kHz up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz.
 
## Powerful and Extensible

 The miniBAE music synthesizer is a high-quality wavetable instrument
 with LFOs, ADSRs, and filters. It can be delivered with a complete
 General MIDI patch bank, or for small footprints a ‘light’ General MIDI
 approximation can be used. Custom instrument banks can be built with
 the Beatnik Editor application.

## Efficient

 Despite miniBAE’s power, the per-voice processor load is impressively
 low.
 
## Hardware Independent – Sound Card-Agnostic
 
 Some other sound systems require consumers to buy expensive (and
 quickly out- dated) hardware sound cards – but miniBAE avoids nearly
 all sound card support issues because it’s 100% software. miniBAE
 requires no particular sound hardware in the host system, only an audio
 output.

## Consistent Across Platforms
 
 Because it’s a software-only solution, consistently great-sounding
 music is much easier to achieve with miniBAE than with many other
 computer music systems. 

## An Inexpensive Cross-Platform Audio Solution

 miniBAE provides the same music and sound capabilities on every
 supported plat- form, so porting music and sound content is a
 no-brainer, requiring literally no additional sound artist work –
 simply re-use the files.


## Acknowledgment:

 Everyone on this list made a contribution in some important way. Its
 amazing to me that two scruffy guys working in our house created
 something that went around the world and in lots of peoples pockets.

Thank you all.
